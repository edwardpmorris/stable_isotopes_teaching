## Content

+ duration: 2 h teaching session; 1 h theory, 1 h practice on PC
+ audience: PhD students and post-docs

## Aims

+ introduce stable isotope tracer techniques
+ provide important terminology
+ give sources of important literature and help
+ give tools for calculations
+ ensure participants can design and analyse stable isotope tracer experiments

## Requirements

+ familiarity with general stable isotope terminology
+ access to PC with R and Rstudio
+ a basic idea for a tracer experiment (optional)

## Outline
    
+ When natural abundance is not enough...
    + tracing nutrient cycling
        + biogeocheistry
        + foodwebs
+ Stable isotope specific terminology
+ Where can I find some help?
    + Important literature
    + Forums, groups and software

## Outline

+ How do I calculate that?
    + Basic calculations
    + Using specific software packages
+ My 'first' stable isotope tracer experimental design
    + Setting up the basic calculations
    + Calculating costs
    + Analysing results
