# When 'natural abundance' is not enough...

## Stable isotope tracers

+ Material with a very different isotopic composition.
+ Allows tracing of material through systems.
+ Non-toxic and biodegradable.
+ No special handling or specific permits needed.

## Stable isotope tracers

Useful for examining the details of flows and processes, for example:

+ ^13^C uptake and fractionation by different photosynthetic organisms.
+ Nitrogen and carbon assimilation efficiency through food webs.
+ Nitrification and denitrification in the water column and sediments.
+ Whole ecosystem nutrient cycling; pelagic, benthic, wetlands, estuaries, rivers, lakes, aquaculture ponds, chemostats.

## Tracing nutrient cycling - Whole ecosystem approaches

include one or two examples of whole ecosystem tracer experiments and the highlight unique findings. 

## Tracing nutrient cycling - Cadiz Bay

~90% of Cadiz inner bay is covered in benthic plants (angiosperms and algae):

+ What role do they play in nutrient cycling?

![Cadiz bay benthic plant coverage]()

## Tracing nutrient cycling - Cadiz Bay

Strong human influence in the region; plenty of N sources.

+ Urban and aquaculture effluents are potential 'natural' tracers.

## Tracing nutrient cycling - Cadiz Bay

Collecting samples of macrophyte biomass and suspended solids near effluent discharges allows tracing of long-term nutrient loading.

## Tracing nutrient cycling - Natural tracers

Interpretting sources is complicated by overlapping, variable stable isotope values and the influence of biogeochemical processes.

+ Using multiple isotopes may help.
+ Test hypothesis with independant data sources.
+ Test hypothesis with further experiments.
    + Increase the difference in isotopic composition between source and sink.

## Where to find material with a different isotopic compositions?

+ 'Man-made' nitrogen from fertilizer production; &delta;^15^N  ~ 0.
+ Biologically transformed N from effluent; &delta;^15^N  > 5.
+ Plant carbon; photosynthetic fractionation gives &delta;^13^C values between ~ -7 and -35.
+ Laboratory grade enriched stable isotopes; range of compounds and enrichment available.

## Adding stable isotope tracers

+ Aim for a significantly different isotopic composition of the source, without a sig. different concentration (within 5 %).
+ ^15^N relatively cheap.
+ ^13^C relatively expensive.

# Questions?

## Questions?
If ^13^C and ^15^N tracers are both relatively similar in price per gram, can  you explain why the costs of using each are so different?

*Hint, consider the 5% rule and their natural concentrations in aquatic systems.* 

## Adding stable isotope tracers

+ Take isotopic composition measurements of the medium (i.e, water, biomass, DIN, DIC), *before* and *after* tracer addition.
    + measurements are ideal (take plenty of samples), however inert tracers can also be used to give a good indication.

## Adding stable isotope tracers

+ Take isotopic composition measurements of the subject (i.e, water, biomass, DIN, DIC), *before* and *after* tracer addition.    
    + take plenty of samples (ensure good representation of 'natural abundance')
    + consider non-linear sampling in time and space.

## Adding stable isotope tracers

Semi-closed systems; incubation chambers, flume-tank, mesocosms, pilot plants, lakes, ponds, inter-tidal sediments.

+ Add tracer to *initial medium* at start of experiment.
+ Measure or calculate isotopic composition of the source.
    + Beware of changing concentration and isotopic composition of the source in time. 

## Adding stable isotope tracers

Semi-open systems; bays, rivers, estuaries, lakes, ponds, sub-tidal sediments, chemostat, pilot plants.

+ Add tracer to *inflow of medium* throughout experiment.
    + Ensure tracer addition matches inflow.
+ Measure or calculate isotopic composition of the source.
    + Use inert tracer to aid calculations.
    + Beware of changing concentration and isotopic composition of the source in space and time.

# Tracer specific terminology

## Stable isotope-amount fraction or atom fraction (*x*)

Previously called 'AP', 'Atom %'.

Amount of a specified atom (isotope) (*n*) of a chemical element (E)
divided by the total amount of atoms of the element within
the mixture (P).

$$ x ( ^[i] \mathrm{E} ) _[ \mathrm{P} ] = n ( ^[i] \mathrm{E} ) _[\mathrm{P}] / Î£ n ( ^[k] \mathrm{E}) _[ \mathrm{P}] $$

For example, the ^15^N fraction, *x*(^15^N), of inorganic nitrate was *x*(^15^N)~NO3-~ = 98 %.

For a full overview see @coplen_guidelines_2011.

## Excess atom fraction, *x*^E^(^*i*^E)~P/reference~

Also called excess (stable) isotope-amount fraction, previously 'atom percent excess', 'atom % excess' or 'APE'.

> Difference between the *mole fraction* of an isotope ^*i*^E of element E in substance P and that of a reference. The superscript E signifies an excess quantity.

$$ x \mathrm{E} ( _{i} \mathrm{E} _{P/reference} = x ( _{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{P} } - x ( _{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{reference} } $$

For example, the excess atom fraction of plant above-ground biomass (AGB) compared to the reference atom fraction of dissolved inorganic nitrate (*x*(^15^N)~NO3-~),  *x*^E^(^*15*^N)~AGB/NO3~ = 10 %.

For a full overview see @coplen_guidelines_2011.
